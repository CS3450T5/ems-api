Data/info needed for the dashboard, loosely in order of priority
* Total energy usage, maybe day by day or week by week etc.
* Energy sources - renewable vs nonrenewable, or more specific breakdown
* Cost of energy production, again maybe day by day for easy comparisons
* Energy usage by department/location - could map this to a layout of the airport for a visual view
* Max energy cap - for a box displaying % of max energy being used
* Potentially a "news feed" box with information on recent developments that could affect energy (implemented a solar array, oil prices going up, higher attendance than usual)


Overall it'd be useful to have a bunch of aggregate data that we can then divide into time segments. Stuff like how much energy has been used today compared to yesterday, or compared to the same day last week, or the same day last year could be informative. Trends over time, etc are easy to visualize with graphs.

Also I'm aware we might not be able to get a live feed, but I think it's easier to treat this whole project as a live feed regardless. Think of it as a "live feed of yesterday". If we want to reconfigure this to be fully divorced from that idea I'm down but that's how I'm currently considering it.
